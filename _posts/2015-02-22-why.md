    There are a huge number of developers that share their thoughts and opinions in regards to our
    industry in the form of blog posts already. So why add yet another? The main intent of keeping this blog will be to act as reference material. Whenever you run into a troublesome scenario, it's always nice to be able to quickly refer back to it. So I'll primarly be treating this space as my own personal archive. Though, I'm sure I'll share a few rants, and or critical opinions of my own.
