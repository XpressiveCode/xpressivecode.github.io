    There are a huge number of developers that share their thoughts and opinions in regards to our
    industry in the form of blog posts already. So why add yet another? The main intent of keeping this blog will be to act as reference material. Whenever you run into a troublesome scenario, it's always nice to be able to quickly refer back to it. So I'll primarly be treating this space as my own personal archive. Though, I'm sure I'll share a few rants, and or critical opinions of my own.

  Infact, I have a few lined up already...

	I also hope that some of these posts might help someone who runs into the same situations. It can take a long time to find a solution, and it's always fantastic when you run into an obscure blog post that has one! It's time to try to give back to a community that has been extremely generous to me throughout the years.
