  Part of me is writing this post in hopes that I've missed something. I would love it if someone out
  there could set me straight. Point me in the right direction. Because if not, it looks like I'm in for a long, frustrating journey with Umbraco.
</p>
<p>
  This particular post is going to kick off a small series, which I hope will help others... for the struggle is real.

<p>
  Here are just a few of the issues that I've come up against, and would like to vent about:
  <ul>
    <li>Outdated documentation</li>
    <li>Dependency injection (also related to poor documentation)</li>
    <li>Working with multiple developers. Worse yet, when you're part of a distributed team</li>
    <li>TDD + Umbraco</li>
    <li>Project setup</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Some of these might end up being grouped together in the same post, we'll see. Again, my hope is that I'm doing something wrong.
  I'm a far cry from being a great developer, so chances are, it's just me. But I can't recall the last time I was this frustrated while working with a product.
