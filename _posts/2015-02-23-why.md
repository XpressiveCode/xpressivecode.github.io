    There are a huge number of developers that share their thoughts and opinion in regards to our industry in the form of blogs already. So why another? The main intent of keeping this blog will be to act as reference material. Whenever you run into a troublesome scenario, it's always nice to be able to quickly refer back to it. So I'll primarly be treating this space as my own personal archive. Though, I'm sure I'll share a few rants or critial opinions of my own.
